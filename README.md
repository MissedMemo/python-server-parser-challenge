# Python Server, JSON parsing/formatting, coding challenge

My implementation of a job application take-home coding challenge.

Task (using NO external libraries):

- load an index.html file on a Python web server using the command start.sh
- retrieve a JSON file containing dummy process & parent ids
- display the PID and PPID hierarchy in a table format


Installation:

- place file "start.sh" in a directory accessible through your system $PATH,
  or type "export PATH=$PATH:/somePath/someDirectory" to make it accessible,
  in order not to have to specify the initial "./" when running the script.
- type "chmod +x start.sh" at the terminal, to make the script executable

Tech Stack:

- Python v. 2.7.10


Notes:

- ??
